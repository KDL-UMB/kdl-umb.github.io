title: Yong Zhuang
description: Ph.D. research focused on developing applied machine learning algorithms to solve real-world computational problems, mainly focused on Spatio-temporal analysis and time series forecasting. I am also passionate about applying causal analysis techniques in feature selection to study how to identify the principal features from the original feature space.
