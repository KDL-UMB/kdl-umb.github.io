- **Hefei Qiu:** In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning **through the lens of intrinsic dimension provides us** with empirical and theoretical intuitions to explain this remarkable phenomenon.
- **Olga Andreeva:** "**Ability to** forget pain and suffering **is vital to** being resilient" - Jensen Huang
- **Yong Zhuang:** Since nearby orbits correspond to nearly identical states, **exponential orbital divergence means that systems whose initial differences we may not be able to resolve will soon behave quite differently- predictive ability is rapidly lost**.
- **Wei Ding:** Colleges and universities must balance many goals, and research universities in particular **aspire to** excellence in both teaching and research. University administrators and policymakers **alike** are interested in ensuring that publicly-supported private and public universities operate at high levels of **instructional and scholarly quality**, but to date **we know little about** whether scholarly excellence **comes at a cost in terms of** teaching quality, or vice versa.
- **Chengjie Zheng:** We believe that ConViT — and more generally, the idea of imposing soft inductive biases that models can learn to ignore — **is an important step forward in** building more flexible AI systems that can perform well with whatever data they are provided.
- **Tianyu Kang:** The remarkable and accelerating progress in neuroscience, both experimental and theoretical-computational, **does not seem to bring us closer to an answer:** The gap is formidable, and seems to necessitate the development of new conceptual frameworks.
