- **Yong Zhuang:** Data science will only **become more critical to efforts** in science in engineering, such as understanding the neural basis of cognition, **extracting and predicting coherent changes** in the climate, stabilizing financial markets, managing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence, where data are **abundant**, but physical laws **remain elusive**.[source](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/15/3932.full.pdf)
- **Tianyu Kang:** Besides the **theoretical guarantees**, we **empirically validate** the proposed algorithm on benchmark datasets across both **classical algorithms as well as modern DNN architectures**.[source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12887.pdf)
- **Hefei Qiu:** Sentence embeddings are an important component of many natural language processing(NLP) systems. **Like word embeddings**, sentence embeddings are typically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various downstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. **Unlike word embeddings**, the highest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled data, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is abundant.[source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03659.pdf)
- **Zihan Li:** We argue that such benchmarks **do little to move the field forward**, and in fact **may hold it back** as they reward techniques that are effective at rapidly solving trivial problems **rather than** performing as well as possible on hard ones.[source](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2330163.2330273)
- **Chengjie Zheng:** We present a **conceptually simple, flexible, and general** framework for object instance segmentation.[source](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maskrcnn.pdf)
- **Wei Ding:** Writing with the Reader in Mind: Expectation and Context Readers do not simply read; **they interpret**. Any piece of prose, **no matter how short**, may "mean" in 10 (or more) different ways to 10 different readers. This methodology of reader expectations **is founded** on the recognition that readers make many of their most important **interpretive decisions** about the substance of prose based on clues they receive from its structure.[source](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing)
